# Opti-tool
Optimization tool for moderators

Hello! 


Aim of this project is to create a stand-alone tool to fetch data about questions from brainly sites in order to provide them in a more accessible and appealing way to a closed community of moderators. 

Version 1.2 
===============

Features: 
  - List of questions with answers/approvals
  - Hiding inaccessible questions (aged/approved)
  - Subjects filter 
  - #Help top-layer
  - Ranking (General)
  - UI (buttons for #help and #subjects-list [RWD : button for #ranking-list])
  - RWD support


Version 1.3
===============

Features: 
  - Added an error screen shown when Google Spreadsheets' response is too slow and the site cannot load its content properly
  - Moved .animated class from list elements to the whole #questionList
